      High above the city, stood the statue of the Happy Prince. He was
      covered with thin leaves of fine gold. He had
      two bright sapphires eyes, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword.
      One night there flew over the city a little Swallow.
      He saw the eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears that running down his golden cheeks.
      “When I was alive and had a human heart,” answered the statue, “I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the palace, where sorrow is not allowed to enter. And now that I am dead
      and stood so high that I can see all the misery of my city.’

    “Far away,” continued the statue, ‘far away in a little street there is
     a poor house. I can see a woman seated at a table. In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill. Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you bring her the ruby
    out of my sword-hilt? My feet are fastened to here and I cannot move.’
    So the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince’s sword, and flew away with it in his mouth over the roofs of the town. He flew gently round the bed,
     fanning the boy’s forehead with his wings.
